### Which certification should I pursue first, based on my experience and professional objectives?

Your starting position will determine the path you travel. I'll present a few alternatives based on frequent circumstances to assist you in selecting the optimal learning route.

## 1. I am completely unfamiliar with the cloud or IT in general.

If this describes you, you should begin with the [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification]. This certification is appropriate for those with technical and non-technical backgrounds who wish to learn about the AWS cloud, its benefits, pricing methods, architectural patterns, and a high-level grasp of the essential AWS services. After completing the CCP, you can proceed to the associate-level certificates.

## 2. I have essential AWS experience or technical background in IT.

If you have prior expertise with AWS cloud services or a strong technical background in IT, you can begin with the associate-level credentials. I would recommend taking the cloud practitioner test as well, as it is a simple exam that covers a bit more about advantages and price schemes.

So, which associate-level credential should you pursue?

Begin with the Associate AWS Certified Solutions Architect. This is the most famous [AWS certification], and it will provide you with a solid and comprehensive grasp of several essential AWS services.

If you're a developer, the next step is to become an [AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate].

If you're a SysOps Engineer, the next step is to become an AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate. This certification teaches you how to optimize infrastructure for AWS and goes into great detail regarding operations and management (including great depth on Amazon CloudWatch).

## 3. I have extensive expertise with AWS, including solid knowledge of the platform and many years of AWS experience.

If you're already on the path to becoming an AWS expert but haven't yet taken any certifications, you might be tempted to begin with the professional level or specialized certificates. Though it may work for you, I would still recommend starting with the associate-level certificates in most circumstances.

Following this guidance will assist you in learning how AWS certification tests are designed and what types of knowledge are examined. You'll also become familiar with the format of AWS test questions and learn how to manage time in examinations, which will be helpful when it comes to the more complex professional or specialty certification exams.
